### And currently we are looking for a React developer

We expect you to be knowledgeable in one or more of these areas, and to be eager to learn about the others.

## Your checklist:
* You have experience with React and some state management solution (preferable Redux)
* You want to work at the forefront of blockchain and open source
* You are able to come up with original and elegant solutions to problems
* You are an expert in at least one language domain, preferably more
* You like to work in a agile energetic startup environment
* You will receive extensive help moving to Berlin if needed
* You will receive a good salary in Berlin
* You will be part of the generous [employee stock options plan](http://neufund.org/esop). (And it’s the world’s first implemented within smart contracts!)
* You will be a part of a strong international team (official office language is English)

## Besides joining a young and vibrant team, this is what you can expect:
* We want professionals with proper experience in our team so we pay properly. Expect a salary that is above average of Berlin startups standards. On top of this, our core team members receive equity of our company — and you will of course become a member of our core team.
* To receive potential bonuses in cryptocurrencies from Neufund, we will provide you with a Ledger Nano S cold wallet, where you can store them.
* Three times a week we serve healthy team lunches and you have the option to get a membership in our sports program.
